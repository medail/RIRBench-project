## Overview

RIRBench is an evaluation framework for blind Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation from reverberant speech. It addresses the fragmented landscape of RIR generation assessment by providing a unified, multi-metric approach, combining established acoustic parameters (T60, DRR) with advanced spectral-temporal metrics (MSTFT, EDR) and a novel peak similarity metric to capture complementary aspects of RIR quality.

## Motivation

Existing RIR generation evaluation suffers from:

- **Fragmented metrics**: different papers use different metric combinations, making cross-comparison difficult
- **Unavailable codebases**: most published models are not publicly released
- **Limited datasets**: single-dataset evaluation hides generalization issues
- **Hidden trade-offs**: single metrics miss complementary strengths and weaknesses

RIRBench addresses these by offering a standardized framework with 10 complementary metrics, 11,500 RIRs from 295 rooms across 11 public datasets, and visual comparison through radar plots.

## Features

- **10 evaluation metrics** spanning temporal, spectral, and perceptual aspects
- **11,500 RIRs from 11 public datasets** with consistent preprocessing
- **Radar plot visualization** for multi-metric comparison
- **Reference results** for FiNS and several modified variants

## Metrics

| Metric | Aspect | Description |
|---|---|---|
| T60 (Bias, MSE, ρ) | Temporal | Reverberation time estimation accuracy |
| DRR (Bias, MSE, ρ) | Energy balance | Direct-to-reverberant energy ratio |
| MSTFT Loss | Spectral | Multi-resolution STFT loss across four window sizes (64–8192 samples) |
| EDR Loss | Spectral-temporal | Energy decay across nine octave bands (16 Hz–4 kHz) |
| Peak Similarity (W, U) | Spectral | Magnitude spectrum peak accuracy, weighted and unweighted variants |

## Datasets

### Preprocessing

All RIRs are processed consistently:

- Amplitude normalized to 0.9 peak
- Initial delays removed via energy-based onset detection
- Resampled to 48 kHz using polyphase method
- Truncated to 1 second with 50 ms linear fadeout
- Converted to mono format (first channel for stereo, W-component for B-format)

Data is split 60/20/20 (train/validation/test) with proportional representation across all source datasets.

### Speech Data

Reverberant training and evaluation speech is generated by convolving RIRs with clean speech from the VCTK corpus. Only `mic1` recordings are used; the same 60/20/20 speaker-stratified split is applied.

| Dataset | Description | Download |
|---|---|---|
| [VCTK Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratt3000/vctk-corpus) | 44,200+ recordings from 110 English speakers with diverse accents, recorded at 48 kHz | Kaggle |

## Installation

Tested with Python 3.9.21.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIIM-Group/RIRBench.git
cd RIRBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from rirbench import evaluate, radar_plot

# Evaluate your model's predicted RIRs
results = evaluate(
    predicted_rirs="path/to/predictions/",
    reference_rirs="path/to/ground_truth/",
    metrics=["t60", "drr", "mstft", "edr", "peak_sim"]
)

# Print summary
print(results.summary())

# Save summary.md, summary.csv (aggregated stats), and results.csv (per-sample data)
results.save("my_model_results/", model_name="MyModel")

# Visualize as radar plot
radar_plot(results, save_path="my_model_radar.pdf")
```

For side-by-side comparison of multiple models, pass a dict to `radar_plot`:

```python
radar_plot(
    {"FiNS": results_fins, "FiNS+EDR": results_edr},
    save_path="comparison.pdf"
)
```

## FiNS Variants

The paper introduces several modifications to the FiNS architecture by [Steinmetz et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07503). Since this repository focuses on the evaluation framework, the FiNS variants themselves are documented here with the key code changes, rather than as redistributed implementations. The modifications described below were developed on top of the open-source FiNS reimplementation by Kyungyun Lee, available at [https://github.com/kyungyunlee/fins](https://github.com/kyungyunlee/fins).

### 1. Adapted Octave Filterbank

Standard FiNS initializes its learnable filterbank with uniform octave spacing. The Adapted Octave variant replaces this with data-driven center frequencies derived from a statistical analysis of 11,500 real RIRs (2048-sample FFT windows with 50% overlap, 3 dB prominence threshold for peak detection). The resulting initialization reduces initial spectral overlap by 12% while preserving the adaptive capacity of the learnable architecture.

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal

def get_calculated_filters():
    """10 bandpass filters with data-driven center frequencies (shape: (10, 1, 1023)).

    Frequency bounds derived from statistical peak analysis of 11,500 real RIRs.
    Replaces the standard octave-spaced initialization in FiNS.
    """
    f_bounds = [
        [25.0, 48.8], [48.8, 95.2], [95.2, 185.7],
        [185.7, 362.4], [362.4, 707.1], [707.1, 1379.7],
        [1379.7, 2692.2], [2692.2, 5253.1], [5253.1, 10249.9],
        [10249.9, 20000.0],
    ]
    firs = []
    for low, high in f_bounds:
        fir = scipy.signal.firwin(
            1023, [low, high],
            pass_zero='bandpass', window='hamming', fs=48000,
        )
        firs.append(fir)
    return np.expand_dims(np.array(firs), 1)

# In FilteredNoiseShaper.__init__, replace:
#   octave_filters = get_octave_filters()
# with:
octave_filters = get_calculated_filters()
self.filter.weight.data = torch.FloatTensor(octave_filters)
```

See Section III.C of the paper for the full derivation.

### 2. Third-Octave Filterbank

The Third-Octave variant replaces the 10-filter octave bank with a 30-band third-octave filterbank following IEC 61260, providing three times higher spectral resolution.

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal

def get_third_octave_filters():
    """30 one-third octave bandpass filters (shape: (30, 1, 1023)).

    IEC 61260 center frequencies from 25 Hz to 20 kHz.
    Replaces the 10-band octave filterbank in FiNS; set num_filters=30 in config.
    """
    center_freqs = [
        25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80, 100, 125, 160, 200,
        250, 315, 400, 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250, 1600, 2000,
        2500, 3150, 4000, 5000, 6300, 8000, 10000, 12500, 16000, 20000,
    ]
    firs = []
    for fc in center_freqs:
        f_low = fc / 2 ** (1 / 6)
        f_high = fc * 2 ** (1 / 6)
        fir = scipy.signal.firwin(
            1023, [f_low, f_high],
            pass_zero='bandpass', window='hamming', fs=48000,
        )
        firs.append(fir)
    return np.expand_dims(np.array(firs), 1)

# In FilteredNoiseShaper.__init__ (with num_filters=30 in config):
octave_filters = get_third_octave_filters()
self.filter.weight.data = torch.FloatTensor(octave_filters)
```

### 3. MSTFT+EDR Combined Loss

The original FiNS loss uses MSTFT only (spectral log-magnitude plus spectral convergence). The MSTFT+EDR variants replace spectral convergence with an Energy Decay Relief (EDR) component, computed across nine octave bands (16 Hz–4 kHz). Three FFT sizes for the EDR computation are evaluated: 1k (1024), 2k (2048), and 4k (4096) samples.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ModifiedSTFTLoss(nn.Module):
    """MSTFT log-magnitude loss combined with EDR loss across nine octave bands.

    Replaces the spectral-convergence term in the original FiNS MSTFT loss.
    edr_fft_size controls EDR resolution: 1024 (1k), 2048 (2k), or 4096 (4k).
    """

    EDR_FREQ_BOUNDS = [
        [22.3, 44.5], [44.5, 88.4], [88.4, 176.8],
        [176.8, 353.6], [353.6, 707.1], [707.1, 1414.2],
        [1414.2, 2828.4], [2828.4, 5656.8], [5656.8, 11313.6],
    ]

    def __init__(

        self.edr_weight = edr_weight
        self.edr_fft_size = edr_fft_size
        self.edr_hop_size = edr_fft_size // 2

        self.stft_losses = nn.ModuleList([
            STFTLoss(fs, hs, wl, window)
            for fs, hs, wl in zip(fft_sizes, hop_sizes, win_lengths)

        masks = [
            (freqs >= lo) & (freqs < hi)
            for lo, hi in self.EDR_FREQ_BOUNDS

        ]

        masks = self.edr_masks.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1)
        band_energy = (mag_sq.unsqueeze(1) * masks).sum(dim=2)
        edr = torch.cumsum(band_energy.flip(-1), dim=-1).flip(-1)
        return edr / (edr[..., :1] + 1e-10)

    def forward(self, x, y):
        x, y = x.squeeze(1), y.squeeze(1)

        mag_loss = sum(f(x, y)[1] for f in self.stft_losses) / len(self.stft_losses)

        kw = dict(n_fft=self.edr_fft_size, hop_length=self.edr_hop_size,
                  win_length=self.edr_fft_size, window=self.edr_window,
                  return_complex=True)
        x_edr = self._edr(torch.abs(torch.stft(x, **kw)) ** 2)
        y_edr = self._edr(torch.abs(torch.stft(y, **kw)) ** 2)
        edr_loss = torch.mean((y_edr - x_edr) ** 2) * 200

        return {
            "total": self.mag_weight * mag_loss + self.edr_weight * edr_loss,
            "mag_loss": mag_loss,
            "edr_loss": edr_loss,
        }
```

The EDR for a single RIR is computed as:

```
EDR(t, b_k) = sum_{tau=t}^{T} |H(tau, k)|^2
```

where `H(tau, k)` is the k-th frequency bin of the STFT at time `tau`. The loss is the MSE between the predicted and ground-truth EDR over all bands. See Section III.D of the paper for details.

### Implementation Notes

The code snippets above are illustrative and not drop-in replacements. To implement the variants, integrate the relevant change into a working FiNS implementation. The paper provides all necessary numerical values (filter center frequencies, FFT sizes, weighting coefficients, training hyperparameters).
